# Space-X_FAlcon9
in this project I have collected, processed, analyzed the SpaceX falcon9 rocket launch past data and built a prediction (classification) ML model to predict success /failure of first stage SpaceX falcon9 launch based on attributes of data such as Booster Version, Payload Mass, Orbital etc.
It Involved following: -

Data collection - Through SpaceX REST API and Web Scrapping, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis - through SQL and visualization tool seaborn and matplotlib, Designing Interactive visualization dashboard using plotly dash and building an ML Pipeline for prediction (classification) model
